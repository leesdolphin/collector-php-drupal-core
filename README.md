## Usage

TODO plainly explain anything a user needs to know to use this (what settings

  path: /
  settings:  # all settings are optional
    example_list:
    - a
    - b
    example_string: testing
  actors:
  - ...
```

### Works well with

- [python-pip collector](https://www.dependencies.io/docs/collectors/python-pip/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/leesdolphin/collector-python-pip/))
